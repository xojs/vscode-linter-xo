> Linter for [XO](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo)

## Usage

Just set up [XO](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo) like you normally would in your project. This extensions requires that [XO](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo) is installed locally in your workspace folder. It will not load a globally installed XO version. The extension will pickup the configuration in your workspace just like running [XO](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo) in your terminal would. You will be able to see your linter work as you type and easily format your code if you want it to!

```shell
$ npm install --save-dev xo
```

or

```shell
$ yarn add -D xo
```

## Auto Format JS/TS Files XO

You can enable XO as a formatter for TypeScript and JavaScript. We recommend setting it up as follows:

In either your workspace or user settings add the following. It's generally best to make xo the default formatter for JavaScript and TypeScript files specifically as it will not be able to format other document types.

```js
{
	// optionally turn on format on save
	"editor.formatOnSave": true,
	"xo.enable": true,
	"xo.format.enable": true,
	"[javascript]": {
		"editor.defaultFormatter": "samverschueren.linter-xo"
	},
	"[typescript]": {
		"editor.defaultFormatter": "samverschueren.linter-xo"
	}
}
```

The XO extension also ships with a fix command that is accessible from the command pallete. This command will apply xo fixes to your JS or TS file regardless of any configuration.

To use: pull up the command pallete (usually `F1` or `Ctrl + Shift + P`) and choose `XO: Fix all auto-fixable problems`.

## Settings

Enable the linter in the VS Code Settings, this is on by default.

```json
{
	"xo.enable": true
}
```

You can also pass in extra options via vscode's settings. Note that these settings will override any configurations that xo finds in your local workspace.

```json
{
	"xo.options": {
		"rules": {
			"semicolon": false
		}
	}
}
```

You can enable the formatter integration to use `xo --fix` as formatter. Requires `xo.enable` to be true.

```json
{
	"xo.format.enable": true
}
```

You can override the severity of found issues, e.g. to make them stand out less than TypeScript errors.

```json
{
	"xo.overrideSeverity": "info"
}
```

Since linting occurs on any file change, large files with complex configurations can get laggy. You can adjust a debounce (in milliseconds) that helps optimize performance for large files. If you notice that lint results are jumping all over the place, or a long delay in fixing files, turn this up. The max is 350ms.

```json
{
	"xo.debounce": 0
}
```

## Usage Notes + Future Improvements

- v3.4.0 added initial support for code action quick fixes so you can highlight your lint errors and fix them one at a time.

- If you upgrade XO while using the extension, you will need to reload vscode for extension to get the upgraded package from your node_modules. The fastest way is to use the command pallete and select `Developer: reload window`.

- Turning on the setting "files.trimTrailingWhitespace" to true can cause a race condition with xo that causes code to get erroneously trimmed. This typically only occurs when debounce is turned (above 0 ms). Avoid using both of these options at the same time.
